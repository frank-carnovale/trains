Documentation for the "Trains" project is automated using Sphinx.

It has been installed and password protected at http://octalfutures.com/trains .

Please ask Frank Carnovale (frank.carnovale@gmail.com) for the password.

In order to create a simple small software release package,
the entire docs build area has been removed temporarily from this directory.
